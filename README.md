# Orange Eats & Drinks

## Your interactive guide to Orange's restaurants, pubs & cafés

This web project provides an interactive, searchable map of some places to eat
and drink in Orange. I've built it as part of [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Running the Application

You have two options for viewing and testing the site:

1. You can [visit the deployed site on GitHub Pages.](https://tobiasziegler.github.io/fend-p7-neighborhood-map/)

1. For testing and development on a local server:

	1. Clone or download the master branch.

	1. The repository's `master` branch doesn't include the Google Maps API key
	that you'll need for the map to work. Obtain your own API key, then ensure
	the `js` directory includes a `config.js` file that defines a JavaScript
	object with variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` set to your key's value. To help you,
	there is a `config-example.js` file that you can rename or copy and then
	edit to paste your key into the appropriate place.

	1. Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies.

	1. After changing any of the source files, run `gulp build` to update the site.

	1. Use `gulp serve` to open the site in your browser. Alternatively, you can use `gulp serve:src` to open the site from the development directory, which can be useful for debugging and testing with unminified code. Note that you'll be shown an ngrok URL in the terminal that can be used for access from other devices.
